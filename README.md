This Grade Prediction Flask App is a hands-on project developed for Week 6 of the "AI & ML – Beginner to Practitioner" course on Upzenix LMS. The goal is to train a regression model using scikit-learn to predict student grades based on input scores and deploy it through a Flask web application. The app allows users to enter subject scores via a simple UI and receive dynamic grade predictions. The project includes scripts for training and saving the model (train_model.py), a Flask server (app.py), and HTML templates for rendering the interface. To set it up, clone the GitHub repository, install dependencies from requirements.txt, train the model, and run the Flask app locally. The app can be accessed at http://localhost:5000, where users can input scores and view predictions. Optional enhancements include integrating React for a more dynamic frontend and deploying the app on platforms like Heroku, Render, or Azure Web Apps. Resources such as Flask documentation, scikit-learn guides, React docs, and MDN Web Docs support development. The final submission should include the complete project folder and a GitHub repository link.
